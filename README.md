TO-DO-LIST

This project provides a simple To Do List interface which allows a user to create a task-list. Each task has a Due date as well as a priority level and description. Tasks can be viewed/sorted by their deadlines. Tasks can be viewed in greater depth by clicking them, which will also display that tasks description. 

This project was made using WebPack, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
