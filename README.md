TO-DO-LIST

This project provides a simple To Do List interface which allows a user to create a task-list. Each task has a Due date as well as a priority level and description. Tasks can be viewed/sorted by their deadlines. Tasks can be viewed in greater depth by clicking them, which will also display that tasks description. To-Do-List uses local storage to ensure that your tasks are not removed when page is refreshed.

This project was made using WebPack, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
